## Installation

1. Ensure you have Tampermonkey or a similar user script manager installed in your browser.
2. [Click here to get the script](https://cdn.bryan-marliere.com/Ionos-bandwithsaving-converter/script.js).
3. Tampermonkey will open and prompt you to install the script. Click "Install" to confirm.

## Usage

Once the script is installed, it will automatically run on the IONOS CDN page (https://my.ionos.fr/hosting-overview). The script replaces bandwidth savings values displayed in bytes with values in megabytes, making them easier to understand.

You can customize the script further by editing it to match your specific needs.

## Compatibility

This script is specifically designed for the IONOS customer dashboard in French (`https://my.ionos.fr/hosting-overview`). Using it on other domains or language versions of IONOS may require modifications to adapt to the specific page structure and text content. If you plan to use it in a different context, be prepared to customize the script accordingly.
